# Capstone OS

This project was built for my high school senior Captstone project. Based off the Mike OS bootloader, this OS was meant to be a learning-based project with the focus on exploring possible careers and interests.

With the MikeOS bootloader with a custom kernel, I was able to make custom applications including a basic calculator and a drawing game. Written purely in assembly language, this OS allowed me to further understand the processes an operating system goes through from the moment the power switch is turned on to user interaction.
