# Capstone OS

This project was built for my senior Captstone project.  Based off the Mike OS bootloader, this OS was meant to be a learning-based project with the focus on exploring possible careers and interests.

#About
This OS uses the open-source [MikeOS](http://mikeos.sourceforge.net/ "MikeOS") bootloader with a custom kernel and custom applications including a basic calculator and a drawing game.  Purely written in assembly language, this OS allowed me to further understand the processes an operating system goes through from the moment the power switch is turned on to user interaction.
